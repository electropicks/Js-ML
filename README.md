In this website, red cars are apart of the traffic and the blue cars are all artifically intelligent sprites.
Every time the user reloads the page the sprite's brains get randomized
To save the sprite that made it the furthest, click the save icon
To discard it, click the trash icon
Continue saving and refreshing until car manages to drive through traffic.
